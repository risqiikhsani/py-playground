The RÂ² score, 
also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to evaluate the performance of a regression model. 
It explains how well the independent variables (features) explain the variability of the dependent variable (target). 
In simpler terms, it tells you how much of the variation in the target variable is accounted for by the model.


coefficient
The coefficient is a factor that describes the relationship with an unknown variable.
Example: if x is a variable, then 2x is x two times. x is the unknown variable, and the number 2 is the coefficient.

if coefficient result like this:
Weight: 0.00755095
Volume: 0.00780526
These values tell us that if the weight increase by 1kg, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00755095g.
And if the engine size (Volume) increases by 1 cm3, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00780526 g.
