Neural networks are categorized into different types based on their architecture and purpose. Below are the most common types of neural networks:

---

### **1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**
- **Structure**: Data flows in one direction (input → hidden layers → output).
- **Applications**: Basic pattern recognition, image classification, and regression tasks.
- **Variants**: 
  - Single-layer perceptron (for linear problems).
  - Multi-layer perceptron (for non-linear problems, includes hidden layers).

---

### **2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Structure**: Includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Applications**: Computer vision tasks (image recognition, object detection, video analysis).
- **Key Features**: Spatial hierarchy of features; learns patterns from image data.

---

### **3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Structure**: Includes loops allowing information to persist; processes sequential data.
- **Applications**: Time-series forecasting, natural language processing, speech recognition.
- **Variants**:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Handles long-term dependencies.
  - Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): A simplified version of LSTM.

---

### **4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- **Structure**: Two networks (generator and discriminator) compete with each other.
- **Applications**: Image generation, style transfer, data augmentation, video generation.
- **Key Feature**: Produces realistic synthetic data.

---

### **5. Autoencoders**
- **Structure**: Encoder compresses input; decoder reconstructs it.
- **Applications**: Data denoising, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection.
- **Variants**:
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Generates new data similar to the input.
  - Sparse Autoencoders: Prioritizes learning useful features.

---

### **6. Transformer Networks**
- **Structure**: Based on self-attention mechanisms; processes sequential data in parallel.
- **Applications**: Machine translation, text summarization, question answering.
- **Variants**:
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
  - GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

---

### **7. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs)**
- **Structure**: Uses radial basis functions as activation functions.
- **Applications**: Function approximation, time-series prediction, and classification.

---

### **8. Modular Neural Networks**
- **Structure**: Consists of multiple independent sub-networks.
- **Applications**: Complex tasks by dividing them into smaller tasks.

---

### **9. Boltzmann Machines (BMs)**
- **Structure**: Stochastic and unsupervised learning networks.
- **Applications**: Feature learning, optimization, and recommendation systems.
- **Variants**:
  - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs).
  - Deep Belief Networks (DBNs).

---

### **10. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**
- **Structure**: Unsupervised learning; projects high-dimensional data onto a 2D space.
- **Applications**: Data clustering, visualization.

---

### **11. Capsule Networks**
- **Structure**: Encodes spatial relationships between features.
- **Applications**: Advanced image recognition tasks where spatial hierarchy matters.

---

### **12. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
- **Structure**: Mimics biological neural networks with spiking dynamics.
- **Applications**: Real-time tasks in robotics, neuromorphic computing.
